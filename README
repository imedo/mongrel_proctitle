= Mongrel process title GemPlugin

This is a simple plugin for Mongrel which changes the process title to reflect
what it's currently doing. You can then determine a given Mongrel server's 
status using "ps". 

For example:

  mongrel_rails [10010/2/358]: handling 127.0.0.1: HEAD /feed/cal/global/91/6de4
                 |     | |     |        |          |
                 |     | |     |        |          The current req (method / path)
                 |     | |     |        |
                 |     | |     |        The client IP
                 |     | |     |
                 |     | |     What it's doing
                 |     | |     
                 |     | Requests processed during server lifetime
                 |     |
                 |     Requests currently queued/being processed concurrently
                 |
                 The port that Mongrel is serving

This is almost entirely based on Alexander Staubo's Rails plugin with the same 
name:

http://purefiction.net/mongrel_proctitle/

The main difference is that the GemPlugin will automatically be loaded by all
mongrels without additional code changes or configuration.

== Installation

This version of the plugin is packaged specifically as a Mongrel GemPlugin. Install 
using:

   gem install mongrel_proctitle --source=http://tomayko.com

Once installed, all new mongrels will automatically load the plugin during startup. If
you would prefer to control which mongrels load the plugin, do not install this gem.
Use the directions below instead.

== Installing into a specific Rails app only
